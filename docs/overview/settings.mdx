The page contains preset settings for sample analysis.
You can read more about settings presets [here](/settings/settings/settings).

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/custom-annot/settings_page.png').default} width="900"/>
</p>

:::note
The number and type of preset settings depends on the initial settings made by the System administrator.
:::

At the top of the page there is
a button <img src={require('/img/eng/add_setting.png').default} width="190"/>
to [create settings preset](/settings/settings/settings#create-preset).

Information on the page is presented as a table with the following columns:
1. **SETTINGS PRESET** - contains the settings preset name;
2. **DESCRIPTION** - contains the settings preset description;
3. **DEFAULT** - the settings preset that contains the
checkmark <img src={require('/img/eng/default_setting.png').default} width="20"/> is selected by default for sample
analysis;
4. **MODIFIED** - contains the date of the last change in the settings preset in M/d/yyyy format.

The table is sorted by settings preset names.

If you hover over a settings preset's row, you will see the following active
elements: <img src={require('/img/eng/set_as_default.png').default} width="22"/> to set a default preset
and <img src={require('/img/eng/delete_btn.png').default} width="20"/> to archive preset.

4. **ACTIVE** - those report templates that contain the
checkmark <img src={require('/img/eng/default_setting.png').default} width="20"/> are active (so they will be
used in the presentation of the results of the analysis of the samples of the corresponding type);
5. **MODIFIED** - contains the date of the last change in the report template in M/d/yyyy format.

The table is sorted by report template names.

If you hover over a report template's row, you will see an active
element <img src={require('/img/eng/delete_btn.png').default} width="20"/> to delete template.

### Gene panels {#gene-panels}

buttons: <img src={require('/img/eng/add_gene_panel.png').default} width="170"/> to create a panel
by selecting genes from a list of all genes or adding genes associated with a specific term
from <a href="https://hpo.jax.org/app/">Human Phenotype Ontology</a>,
and <img src={require('/img/eng/import_gene_list.png').default} width="170"/> to create a panel by importing the
prepared gene list, and <img src={require('/img/eng/import_from_library.png').default} width="170"/> to import a panel
from the library of the most common clinical panels uploaded by the System administrator.

Information on the page is presented as a table with the following columns:
1. **GENE PANEL** - contains the gene panel name;
2. **DESCRIPTION** - contains the gene panel description.

The table is sorted by gene panel names.

If you hover over a gene panel's row, you will see an active
element <img src={require('/img/eng/delete_btn.png').default} width="20"/> to delete panel.

### Capture kits {#capture-kits}

The page contains built-in and uploaded capture kits that can be specified when uploading
targeted sequencing results for more accurate and faster analysis.
You can read more about capture kits [here](/settings/capture-kits).

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/capture_kits/ck_page.png').default} width="900"/>
</p>

At the top of the page there is a button <img src={require('/img/eng/upload_ck_btn.png').default} width="170"/> to
[upload capture kit file](/settings/capture-kits#upload-capture-kit).

Information on the page is presented as a table with the following columns:
1. **NAME** - contains the capture kit name (the name of uploaded capture kit file). If you click on the
capture kit name, you can download the capture kit file in BED format;
2. **TYPE** - contains information about the type of capture kit: Built-in, or Custom (uploaded by user);
3. **LENGTH** - contains information about the total length of the capture kit across all genomic intervals.

The table is sorted first by capture kit type (custom kits go first, then built-in kits), and then by
capture kit names.

If you hover over a capture kit's row, you will see the following active
elements: <img src={require('/img/eng/download_kit.png').default} width="20"/> to download the uploaded capture kit
file (file before the processing) in BED
format, and <img src={require('/img/eng/delete_btn.png').default} width="20"/> to delete capture kit.

### Custom annotations {#custom-annotations}

The page contains the uploaded annotations by which the discovered variants will be annotated.
You can read more about custom annotations [here](/settings/custom-annotations).

<p align="center">

</p>

At the top of the page there is a button <img src={require('/img/eng/upload_custom_annot.png').default} width="170"/> to
[add custom annotation](/settings/custom-annotations#add-custom-annotation).

Information on the page is presented as a table with the following columns:
1. **NAME** - contains the custom annotation name (can be set or changed until the annotation is successfully processed,
otherwise matches the name of the uploaded annotation file);
2. **STATUS** - contains information about the statuses of uploaded
annotations:<br></br><img src={require('/img/eng/process_not_started.png').default} width="160"/> - the
annotation preparation has not
been <a href="/settings/custom-annotations#perform-source-preparation">started</a> yet;<br></br><img src={require('/img/eng/process_not_started_custom.png').default} width="120"/> - the annotation
preparation has started but not yet
completed;<br></br><img src={require('/img/eng/success_annot.png').default} width="100"/> - the annotation
preparation completed successfully;<br></br><img src={require('/img/eng/problems_annot.png').default} width="100"/> - the
annotation preparation has completed successfully, but there were non-critical problems during
processing (details can be found on the custom annotation page in <a href="/settings/custom-annotations#perform-source-preparation">"Status" section</a>);<br></br><img src={require('/img/eng/failed_annot.png').default} width="75"/> - the
annotation preparation failed (details can be found on the custom annotation page in <a href="/settings/custom-annotations#perform-source-preparation">"Status" section</a>);
3. **TYPE** - if the annotation has <img src={require('/img/eng/cosmic.png').default} width="100"/> type it is used as
COSMIC database; if the annotation<br></br>has <img src={require('/img/eng/pathogenicity.png').default} width="130"/> type
it is used as pathogenicity database (data on the variant pathogenicity); if the annotation
has <img src={require('/img/custom-annot/freq_base.png').default} width="140"/> type it is used
as frequency database (data on the variant occurrence in the population); if the
annotation has <img src={require('/img/custom-annot/ruseq_button.png').default} width="140"/> type
it is used as RUseq database;
4. **MODIFIED** - contains the date of the last change in the custom annotation in M/d/yyyy format.

The table is sorted by the date custom annotations were added (most recently added annotations to earlier added
annotations).

If you hover over a custom annotation's row, you will see an active
element <img src={require('/img/eng/delete_btn.png').default} width="20"/> to to delete annotation.
