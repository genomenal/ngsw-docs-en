# Pair of tumor/normal samples

<NormalSampleDef />

Having the results of sequencing of tumor and normal tissues of the same patient,
the Genomenal platform can be used for:
1. Analysis of somatic mutations (SNV/Indels) in a tumor sample and hereditary (germline)
mutations (SNV/Indels) in a normal sample;
2. Analysis of structural variations - for each sample from a pair;
3. Analysis of copy number variations (CNV) - for each sample from a pair.

import SectionDef from '/docs/imported_components/_this_section_for_you.mdx';

<SectionDef sample_type="a pair of tumor/normal samples" />

:::danger Attention!
If you want to analyze germline or somatic mutations in a single tumor sample
(without a matched healthy tissue sample), go to
[the corresponding section](/uploading-samples/tumor-only/tumor-sample).
This is important, since the discovery algorithm of germline mutations in tumor
takes into account a large number of somatic mutations occurring in such tissues and tries to filter them.
:::

For this pipeline, use sample files in **FASTQ** or **BAM** formats.
