# Tumor samples

Having the results of sequencing of patient tumor tissue (without sample of matched non-tumor tissue), the Genomenal platform can be used for:
1. Analysis of somatic and hereditary (germline) mutations (SNV/Indels);
2. Analysis of structural variations;
3. Analysis of copy number variations (CNV).

<SectionDef sample_type="tumor tissue sample(s) (without normal sample)" />

:::danger Attention!
If you have a matched non-tumor tissue sample of the same patient, then a control assay is much more reliable. We recommend you to go to [the corresponding section](/uploading-samples/tumor-normal/TN-sample).
