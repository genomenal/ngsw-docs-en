# Resume Samples Uploading

- If the sample file upload is interrupted due to ***a loss of Internet connection***
for a period of not more than 50 minutes, it will automatically resume when the connection is restored.
- If the sample file upload was interrupted because you ***logged out of the System*** for a period of
not more than 50 minutes (to log out, hover over the login at the bottom of the navigation sidebar,
click on <img src={require('/img/eng/profile_options.png').default} height="20"/> and select the "*Log out*"
option in the menu), then the upload will automatically resume after [logging in to the System](/log_in#sign-in).
- If the sample file upload is interrupted because
you ***refresh the tab, close the tab or browser, or turn off your computer***, the upload won't resume
automatically. To resume it, use one of the following methods:
1. At the start of the application (after refreshing or opening a tab with Genomenal) or
after [logging in to the System](/log_in#sign-in), you will see a window in which you will be asked to resume
the upload of files for which it was interrupted:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/eng/restore_uploading.png').default} width="800"/>
</p>

To resume the upload, drag and drop files or folder containing files into the drop-area or click on it
to open the File Browser:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/eng/failed_upload_window.png').default} width="220"/>
</p>

You can use any of the upload drop-areas to select files, regardless of which file it refers to.
The resume upload form will only accept the same files whose upload was interrupted, and an attempt
to upload other files to this form will be ignored.

When all files with interrupted upload are selected (when selected, the status of the file changes
from <img src={require('/img/vv/turn_off_cond_on_vv.png').default} width="20"/> to <img src={require('/img/eng/success.png').default} width="20"/>),
click<br></br>on <img src={require('/img/eng/restore_uploading_btn.png').default} width="170"/>. After that,
the upload of files will resume from the point at which it was interrupted. If you are not ready to
resume the upload now, click on <img src={require('/img/eng/remind_later.png').default} width="170"/> or
press the ESC key. The resume form will appear each time you refresh the tab or log in to the System
for 10 days from the time the upload was interrupted.

2. On the page of the sample whose upload failed:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/eng/failed_upload_on_sample_page.png').default} width="750"/>
</p>

To resume the upload, drag and drop files or folder containing files into the drop-area or click on it
to open the File Browser:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/eng/upload_window_on_sample_page.png').default} width="400"/>
</p>

This form will only accept the same sample files whose upload failed, and attempts to upload other files
to this form will be ignored. As soon as the right files are selected, the upload of the sample files
will resume from the point at which it was interrupted.
