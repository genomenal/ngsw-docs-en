Having the results of sequencing of normal human tissue, the Genomenal platform can be used for:
1. Analysis of hereditary (germline) mutations (SNV/Indels);
2. Analysis of structural variations;
3. Analysis of copy number variations (CNV), including prenatal genetic testing.

:::danger Attention!
If you want to analyze germline or somatic mutations in a single tumor sample, go to [the corresponding section](/uploading-samples/tumor-normal/TN-sample).
This is important, since the discovery algorithm of germline mutations in tumor takes into account a large number of somatic mutations occurring in such tissues and tries to filter them.
:::

You can find out which sample file formats are supported by the platform [here](/data-for-analysis).
