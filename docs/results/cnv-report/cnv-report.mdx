# CNV Report

CNV Report is a report on the results of the analysis of the patient sample or samples in order 
to detect changes in the number of copies of chromosomes. If all the conditions for a report
generation are met (see below), two reports are generated as a result of the analysis:
**[sample CNV Report](/results/cnv-report/sample-cnv-report)**
and **[patient CNV Report](/results/cnv-report/patient-cnv-report)**.

### Conditions for CNV report generation {#cnv-report-conditions}

CNV Report is generated for the sample if the following conditions are met:
1. The sample is uploaded as ***a non-tumor tissue sample*** (samples with the "NORMAL" type) in FASTQ or BAM format.
2. ***The sample analysis was successfully completed*** (that is, all stages of the analysis have the status
"Complete"). If the analysis failed, then there will be a corresponding message for the sample in the report
for the patient, and the report for the sample will not be built.
3. ***The "Copy number variations discovery" stage has successfully completed***. If the stage failed,
then there will be a corresponding message for the sample in the report for the patient,
and the report for the sample will not be built. If the stage is turned off, then the report
for the sample will not be built, and the sample will not be mentioned in the report for the patient.
If the stage is turned off for all patient samples, then the report for the patient will not be built.
3. The report template is active (adjustable on the "[Report templates](/settings/report-templates/report-templates)"
page).
4. The report template was created before the sample was processed.

If you do not have the "CNV Report" template added and you need it for analysis,
you can contact your administrator or add it yourself, as
described [here](/settings/report-templates/main-templates#add-cnv-report).
