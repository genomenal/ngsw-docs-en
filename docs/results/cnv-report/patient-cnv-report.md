The **“Result”** section includes a report about the presence or absence of a deviation from the normal copy number in any chromosome in all patient samples.

The **“Interpretation of results and conclusions”** section contains a table with the following information on patient samples:

1. Detected CNVs (reducing or increasing the number of copies in any chromosome)
2. Sample coverage
3. Special marks (data quality report):
- No mark if data quality is good;
- “There are non-critical problems with data quality” if coverage &lt; 0.01X;
- “Results excluded due to unreliability. Sequencing depth too low.” if coverage &lt; 0.001X;
- “Analysis not performed, software error” if the sample analysis finished with an error.
