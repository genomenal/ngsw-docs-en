# Parameters

On the "Parameters" tab, you can view and change the sample analysis parameters.

The parameters are divided into three main groups according to which analysis
modules these parameters are responsible for:

1. [Quality Control](/settings/settings/quality-control-settings)
2. [Alignment](/settings/settings/alignment-settings)
3. [Variant Discovery](/settings/settings/variant-discovery-settings)

### Changing Analysis Parameters {#change-parameters}

To ***change the threshold value*** of quality control or alignment metric, or of hard-filtering or
copy number variations discovery parameter, click on the current value and edit.
To save changes, press Enter or click outside edit value container.

<img src={require('/img/eng/change_value_example.png').default} width="400"/>
</p>

To ***change the selection*** of the alignment tool, sequencing type, capture kit features,
panel of normals or reference samples panel, click on the value of the corresponding field and
select the required option:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/eng/change_alignment_tool.png').default} width="420"/>
</p>

To ***disable or enable the analysis module or its parameter***, turn off or turn on, respectively,
the corresponding toggle. When the toggle switch is on, it is blue and shifted to
the right: <img src={require('/img/eng/toggle_on.png').default} width="35"/>, and when it is off,
it is gray and shifted to the left: <img src={require('/img/eng/toggle_off.png').default} width="35"/>

### Applying Analysis Parameter Changes {#apply-changes}

As soon as you start making changes to the analysis settings, the following notification will appear:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/eng/apply_warning.png').default} width="450"/>
</p>

It is not necessary to confirm the changes right away, you can do this when you have finished making
all the necessary changes to the analysis settings
by clicking on <img src={require('/img/vv/apply.png').default} width="130"/>.

:::info
Applying parameter changes will restart the sample analysis process from the step that was changed.
For example, if you change the threshold of the hard-filtering parameter, the Germline SNVs/Indels
discovery pipeline will restart from the filtering stage.
:::

:::caution
If you disable one of the analysis modules, you will lose all its progress, so if you want to turn
it back on, the process will start from the beginning.
:::

:::info
By changing the parameters for one sample from a set (for example, for a tumor sample from a
tumor/normal sample set), you change the parameters for all samples from the set.
:::

To ***cancel*** the changes made, click on <img src={require('/img/eng/cancel_btn.png').default} width="110"/>
or just leave the page - the changes will not be saved.

:::tip
If you plan to frequently use the same parameters to analyze multiple samples, then instead of changing
the settings on the sample parameters tab each time, it is convenient to create a settings
preset that can be applied to samples during sample set adding. You can read about how to do
this [here](/settings/settings/settings).
