# Potential Findings

Potential findings are SNVs/Indels or copy number variations (CNVs) discovered in a sample that meet some
predefined criteria. These may be ACMG criteria, filters for gene panels with additional conditions for rare
monogenic diseases, etc.

Potential findings can include SNVs/Indels or CNVs from report blocks of the type “*SNVs/Indels in ACMG SF genes*”
([“ACMG Secondary Findings Report”](/results/acmg-sf-report)), “*SNVs/Indels suitable for the specified conditions*”
or “*CNVs suitable for the specified conditions*"
(["Reports with mutations suitable for the specified conditions"](/results/mutations-suitable-for-the-specified-conditions)).
To have the listed blocks use the found mutations as potential findings,
[turn on the corresponding toggle in these blocks](/settings/report-templates/report-templates#block-types).

Potential findings are indicated by
the icon <img src={require('/img/results/potential_finding.png').default} width="25"/> in the report:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/results/acmg_potential_findings.png').default} width="900"/>
</p>

### Change the status of a potential finding {#change-potential-finding-status}

To change the status of a potential finding, click
on <img src={require('/img/results/potential_finding.png').default} width="25"/> in the finding's row.
The following window will open:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/results/change_of_status.png').default} width="400"/>
</p>

:::note
If the status of a potential finding that appears in multiple reports for a sample changes, its status will
automatically update in all reports for that sample.
:::

#### Include a potential finding to interpretation results {#include-to-interpretation-results}

To include a finding to [the sample interpretation results](/results/sample-interpretation), select the
status "*Included to interpretation results*" and then determine the pathogenicity of the finding. If the
pathogenicity class of a finding [requires confirmation](/results/main/snvs-indels/pathogenicity#confirm-pathogenicity),
confirm the pathogenicity by clicking on the corresponding option “*Confirm Pathogenicity*”.
Then click on the button <img src={require('/img/custom-annot/ok_btn.png').default} width="130"/>.

The icon of a potential finding included to the interpretation results will change to an icon of the finding's
pathogenicity:
- Pathogenic finding: <img src={require('/img/vv/pathogenic.png').default} width="40"/>
- Likely pathogenic finding: <img src={require('/img/vv/probably_pathogenic.png').default} width="40"/>
- Finding of uncertain significance or finding with conflicting interpretations of
pathogenicity: <img src={require('/img/vv/uncertain_significance.png').default} width="44"/>
- Likely benign finding: <img src={require('/img/vv/likely_benign.png').default} width="40"/>
- Benign finding: <img src={require('/img/vv/benign.png').default} width="40"/>

:::info
If a mutation that is a potential finding
was [included to the interpretation results](/results/sample-interpretation#add-to-interpretation-result) on
the SNV Viewer page, its status will automatically change in the potential findings report.
:::

#### Exclude from the list of potential findings {#exclude-from-potential-findings}

To exclude a finding from the list of potential findings, select the status "*Excluded from potential findings*" and
click on <img src={require('/img/custom-annot/ok_btn.png').default} width="130"/>.

The icon of a finding that has been excluded from the list of potential findings will
change to <img src={require('/img/results/excluded_from_pf.png').default} width="25"/>.
