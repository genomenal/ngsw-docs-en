# Workflow Details

You can get detailed information about the processing of your samples, the status of the stages, as well as
download files with stage results on the "**Workflow details**" tab on the sample page:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/eng/18-workflow-details.png').default} width="1000"/>
</p>

You can also view the details of each analysis stage individually by clicking on
the button <img src={require('/img/results/show_details.png').default} width="25"/> in the row of that stage
in <a href="/results/main/main#workflow">the "Workflow" section</a> of the "Main" tab on the sample page.
To go from the details of a specific stage to the details of the entire sample analysis process,
click on <img src={require('/img/eng/show_all_tasks.png').default} width="150"/>.

### Sample file(s) {#sample-files}

You can download the sample file or files (for paired-end sequencing) at the top of the "Workflow Details" tab:
- For a sample uploaded in FASTQ or BAM format, you can download the file or files (for paired-end sequencing)
in FASTQ format, compressed into a GZIP archive. In the case of an interleaved paired-end sample, you can download
the primary and mate files after splitting.
- For a sample uploaded in VCF or GT format, you can download a file in VCF format, not compressed into an archive,
with the original assembly of the reference genome (hg38 or hg19) and original chromosome names.

Tumor sample file(s) are designated by <img src={require('/img/eng/tumor_file.png').default} width="20"/>,
and non-tumor sample file(s) are designated by <img src={require('/img/eng/normal_file.png').default} width="20"/>.
The file size is indicated to the right of the file name.

### Sample compression {#compress-sample}

In the upper right corner of the "Workflow details" tab, there is a
button <img src={require('/img/eng/compress_sample.png').default} width="150"/>. By clicking on it, you will
open a form for compressing samples:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/eng/compress_form.png').default} width="400"/>
</p>

- To delete sample file(s), leave the "*Delete FASTQ files*" option checked. This option is only available
for samples uploaded in FASTQ or BAM format. After deleting files, it is not possible to restart the sample
processing from scratch, as well as to restart the processing of initial stages, such as "Upload, identify and verify",
"Check quality and cleanup" and "Alignment". In addition, it will not be possible to change the parameters
of the ["Quality control"](/settings/settings/quality-control-settings)
and ["Alignment"](/settings/settings/alignment-settings) sections. Sample files will not be available for
downloading on the "Workflow details" tab. If you want to restore deleted FASTQ files,
please contact support [info@genomenal.com](mailto:info@genomenal.com).
- To delete sample alignment files, leave the "*Delete BAM files*" option checked. This option is only available
for samples uploaded in FASTQ or BAM format, for which the "Alignment" stage has been successfully completed.
After deleting files, it is not possible to restart the processing of stages that use the alignment files,
such as "Variant discovery preprocessing", "Calculate coverage", "Somatic SNVs/Indels discovery",
"Germline SNVs/Indels discovery", "Structural variations discovery", "Copy number variations discovery" and
"Phenotype prediction". It will also be impossible to change the parameters of
the ["Variant discovery"](/settings/settings/variant-discovery-settings) section (except for parameters
for [discarding variants that did not pass the filtering](/settings/settings/variant-discovery-settings#allow-filtered-variants)
and [merging phase groups](/settings/settings/variant-discovery-settings#pg-merge-distance)). In addition,
there will be no alignment results on the "Main" tab (the ["Alignments"](/results/main/alignments) section),
no BAM and BAI files in the "Result files" section in the "Alignment" and "Base Recalibrate" task details,
and no alignment tracks in the IGV browser. To restore the alignment files, reprocess the sample from
the "Alignment" stage.
- To remove annotated variants from [SNV Viewer](/results/main/snvs-indels/variant-viewer), leave the
"*Delete SNV Viewer data*" option checked. This option is only available for samples for which the
"SNVs/Indels annotation" stage has been successfully completed. After removing data, it is not possible to reprocess
the "Generate reports" stage, and there will be no SNV Viewer button
in [the SNVs/Indels sections](/results/main/snvs-indels/snvs-indels) of the "Main" tab, in the sample row
on the "Samples" page, nor for variants in reports. To restore the SNV Viewer data, reprocess the sample from
the "SNVs/Indels annotation" stage.
- To remove annotated variations from [CNV Viewer](/results/main/copy-number-variations/cnv-viewer), leave the
"*Delete CNV Viewer data*" option checked. This option is only available for samples for which the
"Copy number variations discovery" stage has been successfully completed. After removing data, there will be no
CNV Viewer button in [the copy number variation sections](/results/main/copy-number-variations/cnvs) of the "Main"
tab, nor in the sample row on the "Samples" page. To restore the CNV Viewer data, reprocess the sample from
the "Copy number variations discovery" stage.

Leave the checkboxes of the options you want to compress checked and
click on <img src={require('/img/eng/delete.png').default} width="150"/>.
You can only compress samples that are not currently being processed.

### Workflow details {#workflow-details}

The "Workflow details" tab contains the stages that are included in the sample analysis and whose
processing has been completed or is in progress:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/eng/workflow_stages.png').default} width="900"/>
</p>

The stage processing status is displayed on the right for each stage:
- If a stage processing is in progress, its status includes
an icon <img src={require('/img/results/in_process.png').default} width="22"/> and a percentage value of its progress.
- If a stage processing is completed successfully,
its status is <img src={require('/img/eng/complete.png').default} width="100"/>.
- If a stage processing is completed successfully, but not all metrics meet the criteria, it has
a status <img src={require('/img/eng/complete_metrics.png').default} width="100"/>, which indicates
the number of metrics that do not meet the criteria.
- If a stage processing is completed with an error, its status includes
an icon <img src={require('/img/results/failed.png').default} width="25"/> and the specific task at which
the processing failed.

You can expand any stage to see its details by clicking on it:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/eng/stage_details.png').default} width="900"/>
</p>

In each stage details, there is a table with the following columns:
- «TASK» is the name of the analysis task;
- «START» is the start time of the task;
- «END» is the end time of the task;
- «STATUS»: if the task processing is in the progress, then its status contains
an icon <img src={require('/img/results/in_process.png').default} width="22"/> and a percentage value of its
progress; if the task is completed successfully, then it has
the status <img src={require('/img/results/complete.png').default} width="100"/>;
if the task is completed successfully, but not all metrics meet the criteria, then it has
a status <img src={require('/img/results/complete_metrics.png').default} width="100"/> indicating the number
of metrics that do not meet the criteria; if the task is completed with an error, then its status contains
an icon <img src={require('/img/results/failed.png').default} width="25"/> and the task name.

You can expand any task to see its details by clicking on it. The following information may be provided for a task:
- Console output about the task processing;
- Verification problems (for the "Verify" task);
- Task result files: all files are available for downloading, and some can also be opened in the IGV browser
or in Google Sheets;
- Metrics (for the "Check quality and cleanup" and "Alignment" tasks);
- Technical details of the task processing (tool, parameters);
- Error while processing, if the task completed with an error.
