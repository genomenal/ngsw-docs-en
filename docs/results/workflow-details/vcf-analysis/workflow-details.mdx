# Analysis of VCF or GT samples

Files in VCF or GT (TSV, TXT) format can be uploaded
as [tumor samples](/uploading-samples/tumor-only/upload-for-new-patient),
[normal samples](/uploading-samples/normal-sample/upload-for-new-patient),
or [a set](/uploading-samples/tumor-normal/upload-for-new-patient) consisting of
tumor sample(s) and a control sample. Unlike for samples in FASTQ or BAM format, the sample type will not affect
the analysis workflow in any way. The only difference between a tumor/control sample set and a single sample
is that there will be displayed the analysis results of the control sample from the set on the tumor sample page
from the set in addition to the analysis results of the tumor sample itself.

The analysis of a sample uploaded in VCF or GT format depends on the analysis settings selected when composing
the sample set. The analysis workflow of such a sample can only be affected
by [a setting for allowing only variants passing all filters](/settings/settings/variant-discovery-settings#allow-filtered-variants),
[a phasing group merging setting](/settings/settings/variant-discovery-settings#pg-merge-distance) and the settings
from [the "Phenotype prediction" section](/settings/settings/variant-discovery-settings#phenotype-prediction).
Please note that it will be impossible to change anything during the analysis of a sample uploaded in VCF or GT
format after the analysis has started.

Analysis of a sample uploaded in VCF or GT format may include the following stages:
1. [Upload, identify and verify](/results/workflow-details/vcf-analysis/upload-identify-verify);
2. [SNVs/Indels or SV annotation](/results/workflow-details/vcf-analysis/annotation);
3. [Phenotype prediction](/results/workflow-details/vcf-analysis/phenotypes)
if [phenotypes prediction](/settings/settings/variant-discovery-settings#enable-phenotype-prediction) and/or
[polygenic risk scores calculation](/settings/settings/variant-discovery-settings#polygenic-risk-scores-calculation)
are included in the workflow;
4. [Generate reports](/results/workflow-details/vcf-analysis/report-generation) if:
- The sample analysis has been successfully completed (i.e. all stages included in the workflow have the status
"*Complete*").
- At least one active [report template](/settings/report-templates/report-templates), applicable to the sample type,
with at least one [added block](/settings/report-templates/report-templates#add-block) was added to the system.
The template can be applicable to tumor, non-tumor, or any sample type. A report template that meets all of the
above conditions must be added to the system before the sample was processed. If you added or updated a report
template later and want to generate or update the corresponding report for the sample, reprocess the sample analysis
from the "*Generate reports*" stage.
- The uploaded annotation contains SNVs/Indels.
