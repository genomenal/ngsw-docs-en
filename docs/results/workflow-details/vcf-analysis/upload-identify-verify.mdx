# Upload, identify and verify

After the analysis starts, the sample in VCF or GT format is uploaded, its format is identified and the sample
is verified. If any of the following tasks fail, the sample analysis is stopped.

The "Upload, identify and verify" stage of sample analysis may include the following tasks:
1. **Upload**. If you are uploading a sample file from your computer and not via a link, the uploading
process may be interrupted. To restore it, use [the resume upload form](/uploading-samples/restore_upload).
2. **Extract** using [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) if the sample is uploaded as an archive
(GZIP, ZIP, BZIP2, 7-ZIP, XZ, WIM, RAR).
3. **Identify**: defining data format.
4. **Convert to VCF** if the sample was uploaded in GT format (TSV, TXT). The original file in GT format can
be downloaded in the "*Result files*" section in the "*Convert to VCF*" task details ("*Download Original GT_FORMAT*").
5. **Verify** VCF file.
6. **Convert chromosome names** if the VCF file contains chromosomes that are not named according to the UCSC
convention, which prefixes chromosome names with "chr" (e.g. chr1, chrX). After conversion, the VCF file is verified
again.
7. **Lift over hg19 to hg38** if the reference genome version of the uploaded annotation is not hg38, but hg19.
The resulting file can be downloaded in the "*Result files*" section in the "*Lift over hg19 to hg38*" task details
("*Download HG38 VCF*"). There you can also download a file with variants that could not be converted into hg38
("*Download LIFT_OVER_FAILED TSV*"). Such variants are not included in further analysis. You can also open
this file in Google Sheets. After lifting over to hg38, the VCF file is verified.

The uploaded unpacked sample file in VCF format with the original chromosome names and reference genome version can be
downloaded [at the top of the "Workflow details" tab](/results/workflow-details/workflow-details#sample-files).

After the "Upload, identify and verify" stage has successfully completed, the analysis continues
with [annotation](/results/workflow-details/vcf-analysis/annotation).
