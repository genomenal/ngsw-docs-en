# Alignments

The "***Alignments***" section contains the sample reads mapped to reference genome.
Subsequently, during the analysis, it is these reads that are used to call variants.

The results of alignment of sample reads are presented as:

1. File with alignments in **BAM (Binary Alignment Map)** format. To download the file,
click on <img src={require('/img/eng/30-bam_file.png').default} width="45"/>.

2. **Index file for alignment in BAI format**. The file is required for some tools.
To download the file, click on <img src={require('/img/eng/31-bai-file.png').default} width="45"/>.

3. **[Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/)** is an embedded
module for visualization of variations on the genome. To open the module,
click on <img src={require('/img/results/igv_btn.png').default} width="45"/>.
