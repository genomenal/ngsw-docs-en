# Main

The "Main" tab on the sample page contains the following information:

### 1. The analysis results {#analysis-results}

The section contains the main results of the analysis: a separate section with the results corresponds to a
separate stage of the analysis. The availability of the results of a particular stage depends on whether it
was carried out and completed successfully.

</p>

You can read more about each section in the corresponding section of the documentation:
1. [Somatic and Germline SNVs/Indels](/results/main/snvs-indels/snvs-indels)
2. [Somatic and Germline Structural Variations](/results/main/structural-variations)
3. [Somatic and Germline Copy Number Variations](/results/main/cnvs)
4. [Alignments](/results/main/alignments)

### 2. Sample Info {#sample-info}

</p>

- FILE NAME and MATE FILE NAME are the names of the uploaded sample files with extensions
(can be edited by clicking on the name).
- SAMPLE TYPE is the type that was selected when uploading the sample (TUMOR or NORMAL).
You can change the type only by dragging the sample to the appropriate type in the edit sample set window,
or by selecting a different type in the sample row (for runs).
- CREATED is the date of creation of a sample set (start of uploading sample files into the system)
in the format M/d/yyyy.
- READS TYPE is the sequence type (DNA, RNA or UNKNOWN) that was sequenced. Determined by a built-in classifier
that predicts the reads type using the LSTM (long short-term memory) model. If the type is not defined correctly,
you can change it by clicking on it and selecting another type from the drop-down list.
- SEQUENCER is the type of sequencer on which the sequence was sequenced (ILLUMINA, ION TORRENT, BGI or UNKNOWN).
The type is determined according to the ID of the reads from the file in FASTQ format. If a sequencer is not correctly
defined, it can be changed by clicking on it and selecting a different type from the drop-down list.
- SEQUENCING TYPE: Panel (targeted sequencing), WES (whole-exome sequencing), WGS (whole-genome
sequencing), Low-pass WGS (whole-genome sequencing with low coverage), UNKNOWN (the sequencing type may not be
detected for some samples in VCF format). Detected automatically by Genomenal, may be based on Sequencing Type
and Capture Kit selected while adding sample set. The type can be changed
on ["Parameters" tab](/results/parameters)
(["Sequencing Type" parameter](/settings/settings/alignment-settings#sequencing-type):
"WGS" option corresponds to either type "WGS" or "Low-pass WGS", "Targeted selection" option corresponds to
"Panel" or "WES" type).
- ALIAS is a synonymous name for the sample, which can be entered by clicking on the value field.
- CAPTURE KIT is a panel used in targeted selection. Detected automatically by Genomenal, or by user while
adding sample set. If the capture kit is defined incorrectly, it can be changed
on [Parameters tab](/results/parameters). You can use both built-in capture kits (standard panels often used in
sequencing) and custom capture kits uploaded by the user (on ["Capture kits" page](/settings/capture-kits)).
- SAMPLE LOCATION (ORGAN) is the organism part from which the sample was taken for sequencing. Can be specified by
clicking on the value field.
- SAMPLE COLLECTION DATE is the date in the format M/d/yyyy. Can be specified by clicking on the value field.
- METHODOLOGY is the method of extracting the sample. Can be specified by clicking on the value field.
- COMMENTS - can be specified by clicking on the value field.
- ONCOLOGICAL DISEASE, STAGE and STAGE DETAILS are the patient's oncological disease, its stage and stage details,
which were defined for the patient at the time the sample was taken for sequencing.
- THERAPY LINE is the therapy line that was being used to treat the patient's disease at the time the sample was taken
for sequencing.

### 3. Workflow {#workflow}

The section is a table with analysis stages and their statuses.

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/results/workflow.png').default} width="900"/>
</p>

- If the stage is in progress, then
its status has <img src={require('/img/results/in_process.png').default} width="22"/> icon and a percentage
value of its progress.
- If the stage is completed successfully,
then it has the status <img src={require('/img/results/complete.png').default} width="100"/>.
- If the stage is completed successfully, but not all metrics meet the quality criteria,
then it has the status <img src={require('/img/results/complete_metrics.png').default} width="100"/> and indicates
the number of metrics that do not meet the criteria.
- If the stage is completed with an error,
then its status has <img src={require('/img/results/failed.png').default} width="25"/> icon and the failed task
is specified. In this case, you can report a problem to the administrator
by clicking on <img src={require('/img/results/report_a_problem.png').default} width="25"/>, or retry
the task by clicking on <img src={require('/img/results/try_again.png').default} width="22"/>.
- If the stage is included in the workflow, but the necessary previous steps of the analysis have not yet been
completed, then it has the "*Not started*" status.
- If the stage is excluded from the analysis (in [the workflow settings](/settings/settings/settings) used when
adding sample set or on [the "Parameters" tab](/results/parameters) of the sample), then it has the "*Turned off*" status.

You can view the details of each stage by
clicking on <img src={require('/img/results/show_details.png').default} width="25"/>.
Then you will see this stage section on ["Workflow details" tab](/results/workflow-details/workflow-details).

If you want to restart the analysis from the very beginning (not counting the uploading of the sample files),
click on <img src={require('/img/results/restart_analysis.png').default} width="180"/>.
Please note that this button is available only for those samples, all stages of analysis of which were completed
successfully. You can also restart the analysis from a certain stage by hovering over its row and
clicking on <img src={require('/img/results/try_again.png').default} width="22"/>.
