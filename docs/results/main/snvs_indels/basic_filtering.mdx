# Basic Filtering of Variants

Basic filtering columns are at the top of the table:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/vv/basic_filtering.png').default} width="900"/>
</p>

### Basic Filtering columns

1. <font size="4"><b>Origin</b></font>: filtering by mutation type: Somatic, Germline.

:::note
"Origin" filter column is hidden in the Basic Filtering mode
of [Variant Viewer with germline mutations](/results/main/snvs_indels/variant-viewer).
:::

Both here and in all subsequent cases, <b><i>the filtering algorithm</i></b> is as follows:
- Click on the filter window;
- Select the needed filtering option from the drop-down list, or type the option you are looking for in the
search box and select from the found.

Done! Filter applied. The selected filter can be seen in the window (in this case, the "Somatic" origin is selected):

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/vv/set_option.png').default} width="150"/>
</p>

2. <font size="4"><b>Gene panel</b></font>.
You can add your own gene panel on the "<b>Gene panels</b>" page, which is described in
detail in <a href="/settings/gene_panels">the corresponding section</a>, or you can import panels from
the Library of the most common clinical panels. To import, click on "<b>Import from Library</b>":

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/vv/gene_panel.png').default} width="300"/>
</p>

Select the required panels by ticking them in the window that opens:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/gene_panels/checked_panels.png').default} width="600"/>
</p>

and click on <img src={require('/img/gene_panels/import_btn.png').default} width="150"/> to add panel.

3. <font size="4"><b>Gene</b></font>: filtering by gene transcript (shown in brackets). You can filter variants
by several genes at once. To do this, tick the required genes:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/vv/filter_by_gene.png').default} width="200"/>
</p>

:::note
If several transcripts are known for a gene, the list presents all of them:
<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/vv/many_transcripts.png').default} height="400"/>
</p>
:::

4. <font size="4"><b>HPO</b></font>: filtering by a term
from <a href="https://hpo.jax.org/app/">Human Phenotype Ontology</a>. Click on the HPO filter container to open
the term search window:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/vv/hpo_search.png').default} width="800"/>
</p>

The drop-down list contains the main term groups.
You can filter variants either by the whole group or by a specific term.
The term can be found in the group's list of terms, or by searching by name or ID
from [Human Phenotype Ontology](https://hpo.jax.org/app/).
For example, several terms are found when searching for the term “glioma”:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/vv/glioma_search.png').default} width="800"/>
</p>

By selecting one of them (for example, "Glioma"), you will be redirected to this term page:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/vv/glioma_page.png').default} width="800"/>
</p>

On the left, there are the term definition and a comment.
In the middle, there is the hierarchy of the term: the terms above the selected Glioma
term are its ancestor terms (that is, the terms of the groups that include the Glioma term),
and the terms below Glioma are its child terms.
On the right, there are the genes associated with this term (in this case, 45 genes were found).
To filter variants by these genes, click on <img src={require('/img/gene_panels/ok_btn.png').default} width="130"/>.

To ***cancel filtering***, click on the cross in the HPO filter field:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/vv/cancel_hpo.png').default} width="150"/>
</p>

5. <font size="4"><b>Min depth level</b></font> is filtering by sequencing depth.
You can vary the level using both the plus/minus and the slider.

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/vv/seq_depth.png').default} width="350"/>
</p>

6. <font size="4"><b>Saved queries</b></font>.
You can read how to save a query <a href="/results/main/snvs_indels/advanced_filtering#saving-a-query">here</a>.

### Filtering reset

To clear ***all*** filters, click on <img src={require('/img/vv/clear_filters.png').default} width="40"/>.

To reset an ***individual filter***:
- Click on the filter window and then on <img src={require('/img/vv/clear_option.png').default} width="70"/>.
- If the filter allows to select several options at once (for example, filter by Gene), then you can remove
one of the selected filter options. To do this, click on the filter window and then on the line of the selected
option so that it is unchecked.
- To reset the HPO filter, click on the cross in the HPO filter field:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/vv/cancel_hpo.png').default} width="150"/>
</p>
