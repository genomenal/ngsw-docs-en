# Sample Page

On the sample page, you can find information about the sample analysis progress, change the analysis parameters
and view the sample analysis results after processing is complete.
You can open the sample page from:
- the "Samples" page by clicking on the sample name:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/eng/sample_row_on_samples_page.png').default} width="900"/>
</p>

- [the patient page](/add-patient#patient-page) by clicking on the sample row:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/eng/tumor_sample_row.png').default} width="900"/>
</p>

- [the run page](/runs#run-page) by clicking on the sample row:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/eng/sample_of_run.png').default} width="900"/>
</p>

You will see [the sample **“Main”** tab](/results/main/main) where you can find the sample info, the main
results and the workflow stages.

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/eng/tumor_main_page.png').default} width="900"/>
</p>

The workflow (and therefore the availability of results) depends on the selected workflow settings and
the sample type (tumor or non-tumor tissue sample).

From the "Main" tab, you can go to the other tabs on the sample page:

1. **Tabs with generated reports** - the presence of tabs depends on the presence of active report templates
(managed on [the "Report Templates" page](/settings/report-templates/report-templates) in the "Settings" page block),
their applicability to a given sample, and the availability of the results necessary to build a report. By default,
[the following reports](/settings/report-templates/main-templates) may be active for you (the addition of these
reports can be requested from your administrator):

- **[CNV report](/results/cnv-report/cnv-report)** is a report on the results of the analysis of the patient sample
or samples in order to detect changes in the number of copies of chromosomes.
- **Glioma report** is a clinical report on the characteristics of gliomas, based on tumor markers identified in
the sample, and a knowledge base created on the basis of expert knowledge and published research on this topic.

Examples of other reports that can be added to the system:
- **[ACMG Secondary Findings report](/results/acmg-sf-report)** is a report with the variants located
in the genes from [the Secondary Findings list of ACMG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/docs/acmg/).
- **[ClinVar phenotypes report](/results/variants-by-phenotypes)** is a report that includes:
(a) [ClinVar](https://preview.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/) phenotypes that have the risk of developing in the patient
due to pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants discovered in patient sample and associated with these
phenotypes; (b) recommendations that can prevent these phenotypes.
- **[Onco-genetic testing report](/results/onco-genetic-testing-report)** is a report that contains:
(a) [onco-relevant variants](/results/main/snvs-indels/onco-relevance) included to the report by the user;
(b) clinical guidelines corresponding to these variants.
- **[Report with variants suitable for the specified conditions](/results/mutations-suitable-for-the-specified-conditions#snvs)** is
a report with SNVs/Indels corresponding to certain conditions that the user can set in the report template.
- **[Report with variations suitable for the specified conditions](/results/mutations-suitable-for-the-specified-conditions#cnvs)** is
a report with copy number variations corresponding to certain conditions that the user can set in the report template.
- **[Report with variants added by the user](/results/report-with-variants-added-by-user#added-to-report)** is a
report that contains variants included to it by the user.
- **[Report with variants pinned in SNV Viewer](/results/report-with-variants-added-by-user#pinned)** is a
report that includes variants pinned in the [SNV Viewer](/results/main/snvs-indels/variant-viewer) table by the user.

2. **[Bioinformatic report](/results/bioinformatic-report)** includes the file statistics and the reports on the
completed stages of sample analysis (Quality Report, Alignment Report, Coverage Report, and SNVs/Indels Report).

:::info
All generated reports (including “Bioinformatic report”) can be downloaded in PDF format by clicking on
the button <img src={require('/img/results/export_pdf.png').default} width="150"/> at the top of the desired
report page.
:::

3. **[Coverage Analysis](/results/coverage-analysis)** (the tab is visible only for samples uploaded in FASTQ or
BAM formats, and only after successful completion of all stages of analysis) contains information on depth of coverage
and coverage of genes and transcripts in a sample.

4. **[Workflow details](/results/workflow-details/workflow-details)** includes detailed information about the
processing of the sample and intermediate data.

5. **[Parameters](/results/parameters)** (the tab is visible only for samples uploaded in FASTQ or BAM formats) -
contains information about sample analysis parameters.
