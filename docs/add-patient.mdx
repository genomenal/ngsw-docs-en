# Adding Patient

import PatientInfo from '/docs/imported_components/_patient_def.mdx';

<PatientInfo />

In case you want to upload samples for a patient who is not yet in
the system, click on <img src={require('/img/eng/add_patient_btn.png').default} width="170"/> on "All Patients" page:

import PatientPage from '/docs/imported_components/_patient_page.mdx';

<PatientPage />

You will see the patient page.

## Patient Page {#patient-page}

The patient page without uploaded samples looks like this:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/eng/patient_page_somatic.png').default} width="900"/>
</p>

Uploading sample sets is described in the relevant sections of the documentation:
- [Uploading a Pair of Tumor/Normal Samples](/uploading-samples/tumor-normal/upload-for-new-patient) - to analyze
the results of sequencing of tumor and normal (control) tissues of the same patient;
- [Uploading Tumor Samples](/uploading-samples/tumor-only/upload-for-new-patient) - to analyze
the results of sequencing of the patient's tumor tissue (without control, i.e. sample of matched non-tumor tissue);
- [Uploading Normal Samples](/uploading-samples/normal-sample/upload-for-new-patient) - to analyze
the results of sequencing of normal (non-tumor) human tissue.

The patient page with uploaded samples looks like this:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/eng/patient_page_with_samples.png').default} width="900"/>
</p>

There can be two tabs on the page: "Main" and ["CNV Report"](/results/cnv-report/patient-cnv-report)
if "CNV Report" has been generated (see conditions [here](/results/cnv-report/cnv-report#cnv-report-conditions)),
or there are no tabs on the page if "CNV Report" has not been generated.

:::info
On ["Profile Settings" page](/settings/profile#patient-page),
you can configure which tab you will see first when you open the patient page: "Main" or "CNV Report".
:::

There are two main entities on the patient page: [Sample Set](/add-patient#sample-set)
and [Sample](/add-patient#sample).

### 1. Sample Set {#sample-set}

A sample set consists of one or more samples of the same patient.
The date and time the set was added are indicated in the blue bar at the top of the set.
In the following example, the sample set consists of a tumor/control sample pair:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/eng/sample_set.png').default} width="900"/>
</p>

#### Edit Sample Set {#edit-sample-set}

To edit a sample set, click on the button <img src={require('/img/report_templates/edit.png').default} width="25"/>
located on the blue bar at the top of the set. A sample set editing window will open:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/eng/edit_sample_set_window.png').default} height="600"/>
</p>

The window appearance will depend on the analysis mode
that [was selected](/settings/settings/settings#general-analysis-settings) when creating a sample set
(if "Somatic and germline variant analysis" was selected, then there will be a tumor sample placeholder,
and if "Germline variant analysis" was selected, then there will not be one).

In edit mode, you can:
- ***remove one of the samples from the set*** (or change it to another). To do this, hover over the sample
and click on <img src={require('/img/eng/remove.png').default} width="20"/>. The sample will be moved
to the "Uncategorized Samples" section, located on the left side of the editing window (which is also a
Compose Sample Set window). From there, the sample can be deleted by hovering over it and
clicking on <img src={require('/img/eng/delete_btn.png').default} width="24"/>. If the sample will be left
in the "Uncategorized Samples" section, it will be available for reusing in another sample set without
having to repeat the Upload, Identify and Verify stages. Please note that if a sample is removed from the set,
the rest of the sample analysis progress will be lost.
- ***add another sample to the set*** (in addition to the ones already added or instead of one of them).
To do this, upload the sample (see the documentation sections about uploading samples) and add it to the
sample set by dragging it to the tumor tissue or non-tumor tissue placeholder, or by clicking on the placeholder
and selecting the uploaded sample.
- ***change the sample type***: for example, from tumor to non-tumor or vice versa. To do this, drag the
sample to a differently-typed placeholder not occupied by another sample. If the placeholder is occupied,
then first remove the sample from it by clicking on <img src={require('/img/eng/remove.png').default} width="20"/>,
and only then drag the sample to the placeholder. In this way, you can swap the samples in types if necessary.
- ***change a patient for a set***: click on the patient selection window and select a patient from the already
added patients or create a new one by
clicking on <img src={require('/img/eng/add_new_patient.png').default} width="130"/> and filling out the form
as described above.

To save the changes, click on <img src={require('/img/eng/analyze_samples_btn.png').default} width="150"/>, and
to cancel all the changes made, click on <img src={require('/img/report_templates/cancel.png').default} width="150"/>
or outside the editing window. If you change the sample set composition, the analysis of the set
will restart from the necessary stages.

#### Delete Sample Set {#delete-sample-set}

To delete a sample set, click on the button <img src={require('/img/report_templates/delete.png').default} width="25"/>
located on the blue bar at the top of the set. The sample set deletion confirmation window will open:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/eng/approve_delete_window.png').default} width="350"/>
</p>

To permanently delete the sample set from the system,
click on <img src={require('/img/eng/delete_green_btn.png').default} width="135"/>.
To delete the sample set, but leave the samples in the "Uncategorized Samples" section (so that they
will be available for reusing in another sample set without having to repeat the Upload, Identify and Verify stages),
uncheck <img src={require('/img/eng/check.png').default} width="25"/> and then
click on <img src={require('/img/eng/delete_green_btn.png').default} width="135"/>.
To cancel deleting a set, click on <img src={require('/img/report_templates/cancel.png').default} width="150"/>
or outside the confirmation window.

### 2. Sample {#sample}

:::note
A sample is a single sample from [a sample set](/add-patient#sample-set).
:::

To open [the sample page](/results/results), click on its row:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/eng/sample_row.png').default} width="900"/>
</p>

The sample row contains the following information:
1. **Sample file names** (with extension). The tumor sample file is
designated as <img src={require('/img/eng/tumor_success.png').default} width="20"/>, the non-tumor sample
file as <img src={require('/img/eng/normal_success.png').default} width="20"/>. A pair of tumor sample
files: <img src={require('/img/eng/tumor_pair.png').default} height="40"/>, a pair of non-tumor sample
files: <img src={require('/img/eng/normal_pair.png').default} height="40"/>.
2. **Sample type** is the type that was selected when uploading the sample (TUMOR or NORMAL (non-tumor)).
You can change the sample type in the editing window (see above).
3. **Sample interpretation summary** is the information on the number of variants of a particular pathogenicity
class discovered in the sample and included to report
(Pathogenic: <img src={require('/img/results/pathogenic.png').default} width="48"/>,
Likely pathogenic: <img src={require('/img/results/likely_pathogenic.png').default} width="48"/>,
Uncertain significance: <img src={require('/img/results/uncertain.png').default} width="48"/>,
Likely benign: <img src={require('/img/results/likely_benign.png').default} width="48"/>,
Benign: <img src={require('/img/results/benign.png').default} width="48"/>).
Interpretation summary is displayed only
if [the sample interpretation has been completed](/results/main/snvs-indels/snv-details-page#sample-interpretation).
If the interpretation has not been completed, but variants with a particular pathogenicity class have been
included to report, then the interpretation summary will be "*Interpretation not completed*". If the
sample interpretation has been completed, but no variants with a particular pathogenicity class have been
included to report, then the interpretation summary will be "*No pathogenic variants found*".
4. **The last complete analysis stage status** or the status of the stage currently being
in progress: <img src={require('/img/eng/in_process_status.png').default} width="20"/> - the stage is currently in
progress; <img src={require('/img/eng/success.png').default} width="20"/> - the stage was completed
successfully, <img src={require('/img/eng/problems_status.png').default} width="28"/> - the stage was completed
successfully, but not all quality metrics meet the
criteria, <img src={require('/img/eng/failed_status.png').default} width="25"/> - the stage was failed.
5. **Sample analysis progress tiles**. Each tile is an analysis stage.
Blue tiles <img src={require('/img/eng/blue_in_progress.png').default} width="25"/> represent stages in progress;
green <img src={require('/img/eng/green.png').default} width="25"/> - successfully completed stages;
orange <img src={require('/img/eng/orange.png').default} width="25"/> - successfully completed stages,
not all quality metrics of which meet the criteria;
red <img src={require('/img/eng/red.png').default} width="25"/> - failed stages;
gray <img src={require('/img/eng/grey.png').default} width="25"/> - stages that have not been completed
(either because these stages are turned off, or because the previous analysis stages, the results of which are
necessary to complete the stage, have not yet been completed). The number of tiles may vary depending
on the possible course of the analysis:
- The analysis progress tiles of the tumor sample in FASTQ
or BAM format: <img src={require('/img/eng/tumor_analysis.png').default} width="120"/>
- The analysis progress tiles of the non-tumor sample in FASTQ
or BAM format: <img src={require('/img/eng/normal_analysis.png').default} width="120"/>
- The analysis progress tiles of the sample in VCF, TXT
or TSV format: <img src={require('/img/eng/vcf_analysis.png').default} width="50"/>
