# Runs

On "Runs" page, you can upload multiple samples without defining a patient for each sample.
[Run SNV Viewer](/runs#run-variant-viewer) contains all the variants found in all run samples.

To open the page with runs, open "**Runs**" page from the page block of the same name via
the navigation panel on the left:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/runs/run_page.png').default} width="900"/>
</p>

### Create Run {#add-run}

To add run, click on  <img src={require('/img/runs/add_run.png').default} width="150"/> on the "Runs" or
"Samples" page and enter the run name:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/runs/add_run_modal.png').default} height="350"/>
</p>

Then select the type of run samples: ***NORMAL*** if the run will consist mainly of non-tumor tissue samples,
or ***TUMOR*** if the run will consist mainly of tumor tissue samples:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/runs/sample_type.png').default} height="350"/>
</p>

:::info
The type of any run sample can be changed [on the run upload page](/runs/#change-sample-type)
or [after submitting the samples](/runs/#run-sample).
:::

To create run, click on <img src={require('/img/runs/create_btn.png').default} width="130"/>.
You will see the run upload page:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/runs/new_run_page.png').default} width="900"/>
</p>

### Workflow Settings {#workflow-settings}

Select the sample [workflow setting](/settings/settings/settings). Note that this setting will be
applied to all run samples and must match the selected type of run samples (TUMOR or NORMAL).
For example, [Germline variant analysis](/settings/settings/main-presets#germline-variant-analysis) setting
cannot be used if tumor sample type has been selected, as it is only suitable for analyzing non-tumor tissue samples.

### Sequencing Type {#sequencing-type}

import SequencingType from '/docs/imported_components/_seq_type.mdx';

<SequencingType set="run" />

### Add Samples to Run {#upload-samples}

Upload samples using one of the methods below. The number of samples in run is not limited.

:::info
It is not necessary to upload all the required samples at this stage.
Additionally, samples can be added to the run after the start of the analysis, as described [here](/runs#upload-more).
:::

import UploadFiles from '/docs/imported_components/_upload_files_from_different_sources.mdx';

<UploadFiles />

#### Recognizing Paired Files {#recognize-pair}

import RecognizePair from '/docs/imported_components/_recognize_pair.mdx';

<RecognizePair />

#### Change Sample Type {#change-sample-type}

The type of each sample is indicated to the right of the sample card and matches the type that was selected
when the run was created. The selected type is highlighted in blue. If necessary, the type of any sample can
be changed by clicking on another type:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/runs/change_sample_type.png').default} width="500"/>
</p>

The type of any sample can be changed after submitting the samples.

### Submit Samples {#submit}

Once all samples have been added,
click on <img src={require('/img/runs/analyze_samples_btn.png').default} width="200"/> to start analyzing run samples.
If you would like to receive notifications when all run samples' processing is complete, please enable
[the corresponding option](/settings/profile#notification) in your account settings.

### Run Page {#run-page}

After submitting the samples, you will see the run page:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/runs/beginning.png').default} width="900"/>
</p>

At the top of the page, there are the run name and the run description, which can be changed by clicking
on the value field and entering a new text. Below there is a table in which each row is a run sample:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/runs/sample_of_run.png').default} width="900"/>
</p>

### Run Sample {#run-sample}

The run sample row contains the following information:
1. **Sample name** - the names of the sample files with the extension and sample file size.
If the sample file is still being uploaded, this will be reflected in the size information. For example,
it will say "18 B of 240 KB". Tumor sample file is
designated as <img src={require('/img/eng/tumor_success.png').default} width="20"/>, non-tumor sample
file as <img src={require('/img/eng/normal_success.png').default} width="20"/>. A pair of tumor sample
files: <img src={require('/img/eng/tumor_pair.png').default} height="40"/>, a pair of non-tumor sample
files: <img src={require('/img/eng/normal_pair.png').default} height="40"/>.
2. **Status** of the last completed analysis stage or the status of the stage currently being
in progress: <img src={require('/img/eng/in_process_status.png').default} width="20"/> - the stage is currently in
progress; <img src={require('/img/eng/success.png').default} width="20"/> - the stage was completed
successfully, <img src={require('/img/eng/problems_status.png').default} width="28"/> - the stage was completed
successfully, but not all quality metrics meet the
criteria, <img src={require('/img/eng/failed_status.png').default} width="25"/> - the stage was failed.
3. **Stages** - sample analysis progress tiles. Each tile is an analysis stage.
Blue tiles <img src={require('/img/eng/blue_in_progress.png').default} width="25"/> represent stages in
progress;<br></br>green <img src={require('/img/eng/green.png').default} width="25"/> - successfully completed stages;
orange <img src={require('/img/eng/orange.png').default} width="25"/> - successfully completed stages,
not all quality metrics of which meet the criteria;
red <img src={require('/img/eng/red.png').default} width="25"/> - failed stages;
gray <img src={require('/img/eng/grey.png').default} width="25"/> - stages that have not been completed
(either because these stages are turned off, or because the previous analysis stages, the results of which are
necessary to complete the stage, have not yet been completed). The number of tiles may vary depending
on the possible course of the analysis:
- The analysis progress tiles of the tumor sample in FASTQ
or BAM format: <img src={require('/img/eng/tumor_analysis.png').default} width="120"/>
- The analysis progress tiles of the non-tumor sample in FASTQ
or BAM format: <img src={require('/img/eng/normal_analysis.png').default} width="120"/>
- The analysis progress tiles of the sample in VCF, TXT
or TSV format: <img src={require('/img/eng/vcf_analysis.png').default} width="50"/>
4. **Interpretation** is the sample interpretation results, i.e. information on the number of mutations with a
particular pathogenicity class discovered in the sample
and [included to the interpretation results](/results/sample-interpretation#add-to-interpretation-result).
It may include information about SNVs/Indels,
designated "*SNV*", and information about copy number variations, designated "*CNV*".
The information is presented as follows:
- pathogenicity icons indicating the number of mutations with this pathogenicity:
   - pathogenic mutations: <img src={require('/img/results/pathogenic.png').default} width="48"/>;
   - likely pathogenic mutations: <img src={require('/img/results/likely_pathogenic.png').default} width="48"/>;
   - mutations of uncertain significance: <img src={require('/img/results/uncertain.png').default} width="48"/>;
   - likely benign mutations: <img src={require('/img/results/likely_benign.png').default} width="48"/>;
   - benign mutations: <img src={require('/img/results/benign.png').default} width="48"/>.
- message "*Interpretation not completed*" if mutations with a particular pathogenicity class
were [included](/results/sample-interpretation#add-to-interpretation-result) to
the interpretation results, but the sample interpretation was not [completed](/results/sample-interpretation#complete).
- message "*No pathogenic variants found*" if the sample interpretation has
been [completed](/results/sample-interpretation#complete), but no mutations
with a particular pathogenicity class have been [included](/results/sample-interpretation#add-to-interpretation-result)
to the interpretation results.
- empty value if sample interpretation was not [completed](/results/sample-interpretation#complete) and no mutations
with a particular pathogenicity class were [included](/results/sample-interpretation#add-to-interpretation-result) to
the interpretation results.
5. **Sample type** is the type that was selected while creating the run or uploading samples: TUMOR or
NORMAL (non-tumor). You can change the sample type by clicking on the current value in the sample row and
selecting another type:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/runs/change_type.png').default} width="900"/>
</p>

6. **Patient** is the patient from whom the sequencing sample was obtained. To define a patient for a sample,
click on the current value ("-") in the sample row and select the patient from drop-down list or add a new one:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/runs/patient_options.png').default} width="900"/>
</p>

After defining a patient for a sample, the sample data will be presented not only ***on the run page***:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/runs/patient_1.png').default} width="900"/>
</p>

but also ***on this patient page***:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/runs/patient_sample.png').default} width="900"/>
</p>

In this case, the sample page is the same - regardless of whether you accessed it from the run page or
from the patient page. Any changes, including deleting the sample, will be reflected on both pages.

#### Sample Analysis Results {#sample-analysis-results}

The results for each run sample are on its page. The sample run page is the same as the sample patient page.
A description of the results can be found [here](/results/results).

#### Change the Sample Workflow {#tweak-sample-workflow}

You can change the sample workflow (on ["Parameters" tab](/results/parameters) on the sample page)
and [restart sample processing](/results/main/main#workflow). Changes in the workflow
only affect the analysis of the specific sample for which they are made.

#### Delete Sample {#delete-sample}

To delete a sample, hover over its row and click on <img src={require('/img/eng/delete_btn.png').default} width="20"/>.
You will see a confirmation window for deleting the sample:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/eng/approve_delete_window.png').default} width="350"/>
</p>

To permanently delete the sample from the system,
click on <img src={require('/img/eng/delete_green_btn.png').default} width="135"/>.
To remove the sample from the run, but leave the samples in the "Uncategorized Samples" section (so that they
will be available for reusing in sample set without having to repeat the Upload, Identify and Verify stages),
uncheck <img src={require('/img/eng/check.png').default} width="25"/> and then
click on <img src={require('/img/eng/delete_green_btn.png').default} width="135"/>.
To cancel deleting a sample, click on <img src={require('/img/report_templates/cancel.png').default} width="150"/>
or outside the confirmation window.

### Run SNV Viewer {#run-variant-viewer}

Run SNV Viewer is an embedded service for viewing and analyzing the variants discovered in all run samples
for which the germline or somatic SNVs/Indels annotation stage has been successfully completed. Run SNV Viewer
is not much different from Sample SNV Viewer (a detailed description of Sample SNV Viewer can be
found [here](/results/main/snvs-indels/variant-viewer)). Run SNV Viewer and Run Sample SNV Viewer
are connected with each other: if you pin or interpret a variant, etc. in Run SNV Viewer, the variant
state is immediately updated in Run Sample SNV Viewer, and vice versa.

To open Run SNV Viewer, click on <img src={require('/img/runs/vv_btn.png').default} width="120"/> on the run page.

**Features of Run SNV Viewer (as opposed to Sample SNV Viewer):**

#### 1. "Sample" Column {#sample-column}

Run SNV Viewer has an additional "**Sample**" column that contains the name of the run sample in which
the variant was discovered. By "Sample" column, you can sort the table in ascending or descending order (to do this,
you need to click on the column name once to sort in ascending order, and twice - in descending order).
You can open SNV Viewer page of a particular sample by clicking on its name and selecting the corresponding option:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/runs/open_vv.png').default} width="290"/>
</p>

:::info
The variants in Run SNV Viewer are the result of combining the variants discovered in all run samples but
not their intersection. Variants that are identical but discovered in different samples will always differ
in the value of "Sample" column.
:::

#### 2. Basic Filtering Column "Samples" {#samples-filter}

To filter variants by "Sample" column, there is a basic filtering column "**Samples**" in Run SNV Viewer
(added [by default](/settings/profile#basic-mode-filters)). To filter variants by the run samples
in which they were discovered, click on the filter
window <img src={require('/img/runs/sample_filtering.png').default} width="150"/> and check the boxes for
required samples
in the drop-down list (or click on <img src={require('/img/runs/choose_all.png').default} width="100"/>):

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/runs/sample_choice.png').default} width="300"/>
</p>

Done! The filter has been applied. The samples that have been selected for filtering the variants
can be seen in the same window:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/runs/sample_name.png').default} width="160"/>
</p>

To see all the full sample names, hover over the filter window.

To clear the filter by samples, click on the filter window,
and then on <img src={require('/img/vv/clear_option.png').default} width="70"/>.

:::info
The basic filtering column "Samples" is also available
in [advanced filtering mode](/results/main/snvs-indels/advanced-filtering) of Run SNV Viewer:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/runs/in_advanced_search.png').default} width="900"/>
</p>

:::

#### 3. Sample Interpretation {#sample-interpretation}

There is an additional way to complete and resume interpretation for run samples
in the run SNV Viewer. Other ways are described [here](/results/sample-interpretation#complete).
To ***complete the sample interpretation***, click on the sample name in a variant row and select
the corresponding option:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/runs/finish_interpretation.png').default} width="290"/>
</p>

You will see a confirmation window. For non-tumor samples, it looks like this:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/vv/interpretation_window_normal.png').default} width="400"/>
</p>

And for tumor samples, it also includes fields about the oncological disease:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/vv/interpretation_window.png').default} width="400"/>
</p>

The "*Interpretation results*" field provides information about the number of mutations with a certain pathogenicity
class discovered in the sample and included to the interpretation results. The field may include information about
SNVs/Indels, designated "*SNV*", and information about copy number variations, designated "*CNV*". The information
is presented in the form of pathogenicity icons indicating the number of mutations with this pathogenicity:
- pathogenic mutations: <img src={require('/img/results/pathogenic.png').default} width="48"/>;
- likely pathogenic mutations: <img src={require('/img/results/likely_pathogenic.png').default} width="48"/>;
- mutations of uncertain significance: <img src={require('/img/results/uncertain.png').default} width="48"/>;
- likely benign mutations: <img src={require('/img/results/likely_benign.png').default} width="48"/>;
- benign mutations: <img src={require('/img/results/benign.png').default} width="48"/>.

If no mutations with a particular pathogenicity class have been included to the interpretation results, then the
field value will be "*No pathogenic variants found*".

For tumor samples, you can also specify in the confirmation window the oncological disease, its stage, and stage
details which were defined for the patient, as well as the therapy line used to treat the patient's disease, at the
time the sample was taken for sequencing.

To confirm completing interpretation, click on <img src={require('/img/custom-annot/ok_btn.png').default} width="130"/>.

Run samples with completed interpretation are marked with <img src={require('/img/runs/done.png').default} width="25"/>:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/runs/done_sample.png').default} height="110"/>
</p>

To ***resume sample interpretation***, click on the sample name in a variant row and select
the corresponding option:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/runs/restore_interpretation.png').default} width="300"/>
</p>

#### 4. Basic Filter "Sample status" {#sample-interpretation-status-filter}

To filter variants by sample interpretation status (completed or uncompleted), there is a basic filter
"**Sample status**" in Run SNV Viewer. The filter is not available by default; it can be added
on ["Profile settings" page](/settings/profile#basic-mode-filters) ("Sample Interpretation Status" option).
To filter variants by the interpretation status of run samples
in which the variants were discovered, click on the filter
window <img src={require('/img/runs/sample_status.png').default} width="150"/> and
select the required status from the drop-down list:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/runs/interpretation_options.png').default} width="330"/>
</p>

To clear the filter, click on the filter window,
and then on <img src={require('/img/vv/clear_option.png').default} width="70"/>.

You can also filter by sample interpretation status
in [advanced filtering mode](/results/main/snvs-indels/advanced-filtering)
using ["Sample Status" filter](/results/main/snvs-indels/advanced-filtering#single-value-filters). In this case,
it is not necessary to add an additional basic filter "Sample status" in the settings.

#### 5. Occurrence in Run {#occurrence-in-run}

On ["Common" tab of the variant details panel](/results/main/snvs-indels/snv-details-panel#common-tab)
in run SNV Viewer and run sample SNV Viewer, there is information on the number of run samples
in which the variant occurs. For example, in the following case, a variant was discovered in two of the
three run samples:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/runs/occurrence.png').default} width="450"/>
</p>

Variants can be filtered by occurrence in run
using ["Occurrence in Run" filter](/results/main/snvs-indels/advanced-filtering#common)
in [advanced filtering mode](/results/main/snvs-indels/advanced-filtering).

### Upload More Samples {#upload-more}

To add samples to the run in addition to the samples uploaded earlier, click the
button <img src={require('/img/runs/upload_samples.png').default} width="140"/> on the run page.
You will see new samples uploading form above the already uploaded samples:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/runs/upload_page.png').default} width="1000"/>
</p>

Upload the samples as described [above](/runs#upload-samples) and
click on <img src={require('/img/runs/analyze_samples_btn.png').default} width="200"/>.

While new samples are being processed, Run SNV Viewer will be unavailable.

### Archive, Restore and Delete Run {#delete-run}

To ***archive run*** and its samples, hover over the run row on "Runs" page and
click on <img src={require('/img/eng/delete_btn.png').default} width="18"/>. The run will be moved to
"**Archive**" page from "Runs" page block. On "Archive" page, you can:
1. ***Restore run*** by hovering over the run row and
clicking on <img src={require('/img/eng/restore_btn.png').default} width="22"/>. The run will then be moved
back to "Runs" page.
2. ***Delete run*** and its samples by hovering over the run row and
clicking on <img src={require('/img/eng/delete_btn.png').default} width="18"/>.
Then you will see a confirmation window for deleting the run:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/runs/confirmation_run.png').default} width="350"/>
</p>

To confirm the run deletion, click on <img src={require('/img/runs/confirm.png').default} width="150"/>.
To cancel deleting a run, click on <img src={require('/img/report_templates/cancel.png').default} width="150"/>
or outside the confirmation window.

In addition, you can delete all archived runs by
clicking on <img src={require('/img/runs/clear_archive_btn.png').default} width="170"/>.
