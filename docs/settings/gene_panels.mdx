# Gene Panels

In this section, you can add gene panels so that you can filter the discovered variants by them.
The gene panel is a set of genes of interest (for example, genes associated with a specified phenotype).

To open the section with gene panels, go to the "**Gene panels**" page from the "Settings" page block
through the navigation panel on the left:

</p>

## Add a gene panel

There are 4 ways to add a panel to the system:
1. [Selection of genes of interest from all genes (by name or Ensembl code)](/settings/gene_panels#1-adding-genes-from-the-list-of-all-genes-to-the-panel);
2. [Adding genes associated with a certain phenotype from HPO](/settings/gene_panels#2-adding-genes-from-hpo-to-the-panel);
3. [Import of a pre-prepared gene list](/settings/gene_panels#3-import-gene-list);
4. [Import panel from the library of the most common clinical panels](/settings/gene_panels#4-import-gene-panel-from-library).

:::tip
When adding a panel, the first and second ways can be combined.
:::

### 1. Adding genes from the list of all genes to the panel

1. Click on <img src={require('/img/eng/add_gene_panel.png').default} width="170"/> to open the form of
adding a gene panel:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/gene_panels/add_gene_panel_form.png').default} height="700"/>
</p>

2. In the opened form, enter gene panel name in the **Name** field.
You can also add a panel description.

3. Add genes to the panel. To do this, enter official gene symbol or Ensembl gene ID (ENSG...) into the search box.
Among the found genes, select one or several ones, click on its/their row(s), and then
click on <img src={require('/img/gene_panels/add_btn.png').default} width="40"/>:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/gene_panels/add_gene.png').default} height="350"/>
</p>

Among the genes added to the panel, you can search, as well as remove genes from the panel (to do so, click on the
gene row, and then click on <img src={require('/img/gene_panels/remove_gene.png').default} width="40"/>):

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/gene_panels/remove_example.png').default} height="350"/>
</p>

4. After you have added all the needed genes to the panel,
click on <img src={require('/img/eng/create_btn.png').default} width="130"/>.
A gene panel will be added to the system.

### 2. Adding genes from HPO to the panel

1. Click on <img src={require('/img/eng/add_gene_panel.png').default} width="170"/> to open the form of
adding a gene panel:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/gene_panels/add_gene_panel_form.png').default} height="700"/>
</p>

2. In the opened form, enter gene panel name in the **Name** field.
You can also add a panel description.

3. Click on <img src={require('/img/gene_panels/add_from_hpo.png').default} width="280"/>.
The search form for <a href="https://hpo.jax.org/app/">Human Phenotype Ontology</a> will open:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/vv/hpo_search.png').default} width="800"/>
</p>

The drop-down list contains the main term groups.
You can add to the panel both genes associated with a whole group of terms and genes associated with a specific term.
The term can be found in the group's list of terms, or by searching by name or ID
from [Human Phenotype Ontology](https://hpo.jax.org/app/).
For example, several terms are found when searching for the term “glioma”:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/vv/glioma_search.png').default} width="800"/>
</p>

By selecting one of them (for example, "Glioma"), you will be redirected to this term page:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/vv/glioma_page.png').default} width="800"/>
</p>

On the right, there are the term definition and a comment.
In the middle, there is the hierarchy of the term: the terms above the selected Glioma
term are its ancestor terms (that is, the terms of the groups that include the Glioma term),
and the terms below Glioma are its child terms.
On the right, there are the genes associated with this term (in this case, 45 genes were found).
If you want to add the found genes to the panel,
click on <img src={require('/img/gene_panels/ok_btn.png').default} width="130"/>.
To exit the form without adding genes to the panel,
click on <img src={require('/img/gene_panels/cancel_btn.png').default} width="150"/>.

If you have added genes from HPO to the panel, they will be displayed in the list on the right.
You can search among them, as well as remove genes from the panel (to do so, click on the gene row, and then
click on <img src={require('/img/gene_panels/remove_gene.png').default} width="40"/>):

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/gene_panels/remove_hpo_gene.png').default} height="350"/>
</p>

4. After you have added all the needed genes to the panel,
click on <img src={require('/img/eng/create_btn.png').default} width="130"/>.
A gene panel will be added to the system.

### 3. Import gene list

1. Click on <img src={require('/img/eng/import_gene_list.png').default} width="170"/> to open the form of
importing gene list:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/gene_panels/import_form.png').default} height="500"/>
</p>

2. In the opened form, enter gene panel name in the **Name** field.
You can also add a panel description.

3. Enter gene list in the **Genes** area. The list must include only official gene symbols and/or
Ensembl gene IDs (ENSG...) separated by commas or new lines.
It is preferable to use Ensembl ID or unique gene synonym that correspond to only one Ensembl ID,
since when using gene symbols, ambiguity may arise due to the existence of human alternative sequence
genes (in the given example, the *MUC6* gene has three such genes:
[ENSG00000277281](https://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Summary?db=core;g=ENSG00000277281),
[ENSG00000277518](https://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Summary?db=core;g=ENSG00000277518),
[ENSG00000283350](https://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Summary?db=core;g=ENSG00000283350)):

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/gene_panels/ambigous_gene.png').default} width="600"/>
</p>

4. Click on <img src={require('/img/eng/create_btn.png').default} width="130"/> to add gene panel to the system.

### 4. Import gene panel from library

1. Click on <img src={require('/img/eng/import_from_library.png').default} width="170"/> to open the form of
importing gene panel:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/gene_panels/import_from_library.png').default} height="700"/>
</p>

2. In the opened form, tick the required panels:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/gene_panels/checked_panels.png').default} width="600"/>
</p>

3. Click on <img src={require('/img/gene_panels/import_btn.png').default} width="170"/>.

## Edit a gene panel

To add or remove genes from the added panel, click on the panel row on the "Gene panels" page.
In the opened form, you can change the name and description of the panel,
remove and add genes to the panel (you can add genes either from the list of all genes or from HPO).
After making changes click on <img src={require('/img/group_analysis/save_btn.png').default} width="150"/>.

## Delete a gene panel

To remove a gene panel from the system, hover over its row on the "Gene panels" page and click on the
appeared <img src={require('/img/eng/delete_btn.png').default} width="21"/> button.
