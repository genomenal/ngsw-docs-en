## Patient page {#patient-page}

There can be two tabs on [the patient page](/add-patient#patient-page): ["Main"](/add-patient#patient-page)
and ["CNV Report"](/results/cnv-report/patient-cnv-report) if "CNV Report" has been generated
(see conditions [here](/results/cnv-report/cnv-report#cnv-report-conditions)):

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/eng/patient_page_with_samples.png').default} width="900"/>
</p>

In this section, you can configure which tab you will see first when you open the patient page:
- the "Main" tab, which contains information about the patient and uploaded sample sets (chosen by default);
- the "CNV Report" tab with a report on the results of the copy number analysis in the patient samples.

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/eng/patient_page.png').default} width="400"/>
</p>

:::info
If the patient "CNV Report" has not been generated at all or is still being generated,
then even if you have selected the "CNV Report" tab here, the "Main" tab will open.

## SNV Viewer {#variant-viewer}

SNV Viewer is an embedded service for viewing and analyzing variants.
It is described in detail in [the corresponding section](/results/main/snvs-indels/variant-viewer).

### Filtering mode {#filtering-mode}

SNV Viewer has two variant filtering modes: [Basic](/results/main/snvs-indels/basic-filtering) with
basic filters and [Advanced](/results/main/snvs-indels/advanced-filtering) with more
filters and the ability to compose complex queries with multiple filter conditions.

In this section, you can configure which filtering mode you will see when you first open
the sample SNV Viewer page (Basic Filtering chosen by default):

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/eng/search.png').default} width="250"/>
</p>

### Filters in Basic Filtering mode {#basic-mode-filters}

The default filters are described [here](/results/main/snvs-indels/basic-filtering#basic-filtering-columns):

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/vv/basic_filtering.png').default} width="900"/>
</p>

You can change the choice of filters (remove or add new ones):

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/eng/filters.png').default} width="400"/>
</p>

Available filters:
- **Samples** is a filter of variants by run samples in which these variants were discovered.
Displayed only in [the run SNV Viewer](/runs#run-variant-viewer). Added [by default](/runs#samples-filter).
- **Sample Interpretation Status** is a filter of variants by the interpretation status of the run sample
in which these variants were discovered (completed or not completed interpretation).
Displayed only in [the run SNV Viewer](/runs#run-variant-viewer).
- **Origin** is a variant filter by mutation type: Somatic or Germline.
Added [by default](/results/main/snvs-indels/basic-filtering#origin). Not displayed
in [SNV Viewer with germline mutations](/results/main/snvs-indels/variant-viewer)
and [the group analysis SNV Viewer](/group-analysis#group-analysis-variant-viewer).
- **Gene panel** is a variant filter by [gene panel](/settings/gene-panels).

- **Gene** is a variant filter by gene transcripts in which variants are located.
Added [by default](/results/main/snvs-indels/basic-filtering#gene).
- **Human Phenotype Ontology** (HPO) is a variant filter by genes associated with terms
from a vocabulary of phenotypic abnormalities encountered in human
disease <a href="https://hpo.jax.org/app/">HPO</a>. Added [by default](/results/main/snvs-indels/basic-filtering#hpo).
- **Pathogenicity** is a variant filter by [pathogenicity](/results/main/snvs-indels/pathogenicity)
determined [manually by the user](/results/main/snvs-indels/pathogenicity#manually-determined-pathogenicity),
[by ACMG criteria](/results/main/snvs-indels/pathogenicity#define-pathogenicity-on-acmg-tab)
or [by pathogenicity database](/results/main/snvs-indels/pathogenicity#define-pathogenicity-by-base): Pathogenic,
Likely pathogenic, Uncertain significance conflict (conflicting pathogenicity interpretation), Uncertain significance,
Likely benign, Benign, Undefined.
- **Label** is a variant filter by [significance defined by the user](/results/main/snvs-indels/variant-viewer#label):
High significance, Moderate significance, Low significance, Sequencing error, Undefined.
- **ClinVar** is a variant filter by the clinical significance of the phenotype
according to [ClinVar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/) database (you can find the
description of values [here](https://preview.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/docs/clinsig/#clinsig_scv)).
- **Consequence** is a variant filter by effects on genes.
The values are described [here](/results/main/snvs-indels/variant-viewer#variant-consequences).
- **Caller Filters** is a variant filter by GATK variant filters.
- **Min Depth level** is a variant filtering scale by the minimum level of sequencing depth.
Added [by default](/results/main/snvs-indels/basic-filtering#depth-scale).

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/vv/seq_depth.png').default} width="350"/>
</p>

- **Trio GT** is a variant filter by inheritance: *De novo* variants, Newly formed homozygotes
(homozygotes in proband that are heterozygous in parents) or Single parent-inherited.
Added by default, available only in [Family group analysis](/group-analysis#group-analysis-variant-viewer)
for Trio case (Proband, Father and Mother).
- **gnomAD 3 AF** is a variant filter by allele frequency (AF)
in [gnomAD v3](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/news/2020-10-gnomad-v3-1/) database:
* <0.05 (threshold between common and rare variants) or empty (no allele frequency data in gnomAD);
* <0.02 (conditional threshold of a hypomorph) or empty;
* <0.01 (estimated threshold of autosomal recessive inheritance) or empty;
* <0.005 (estimated threshold of X-linked inheritance) or empty;
* <0.0001 (estimated threshold of autosomal dominant inheritance) or empty.
- **Region** - filter variants by the position on genome (chromosome, start and end positions).

### Preferred gene transcript model {#transcripts}

On ["Gene" tab of the variant details panel](/results/main/snvs-indels/snv-details-panel#transcripts),
gene transcripts from two databases are available: [Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Info/Index)
and [RefSeq](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/). By default, a table with transcripts from Ensembl is shown.

In this section, you can configure which gene transcript model will be shown by default:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/eng/transcripts.png').default} width="300"/>
</p>

### Advanced filtering conditions {#advanced-filtering-conditions}

In [advanced filtering mode](/results/main/snvs-indels/advanced-filtering), the query conditions for
the searched variants are displayed at the top of the SNV Viewer table. When there are a lot of
conditions in a query, it is convenient to [collapse](/results/main/snvs-indels/advanced-filtering#apply-query)
them so that they do not take up much space on the page.

In this section, you can configure whether the query conditions will be expanded (by default) or
collapsed immediately after applying the filtering query:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/eng/query_conditions.png').default} width="250"/>
</p>

## SNV & CNV Viewer {#variant-viewers}

SNV Viewer is an embedded service for viewing and analyzing variants.
It is described in detail in [the corresponding section](/results/main/snvs-indels/variant-viewer).<br></br>
CNV Viewer is an embedded service for viewing and analyzing copy number variations (CNVs).

### Variant details bottom panel {#variant-details-bottom-panel}

[The variant detailed information panel](/results/main/snvs-indels/snv-details-panel) contains
main information about the selected variant. By default, it is expanded at the bottom of the
SNV or CNV Viewer table. If you don't usually use the panel, you can hide it from SNV and CNV Viewers
by selecting the "Collapse" option:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/eng/hidden_panel.png').default} width="250"/>
</p>

## Return to default settings {#default-settings}

If you have made changes to the language selection, navigation bar, patient page, SNV Viewer, or
CNV Viewer settings, you can return to the default settings by
clicking on <img src={require('/img/eng/default.png').default} width="150"/>. Please note that the action
will immediately reset all changes that you made on the page (except for changes to email, login and password).
