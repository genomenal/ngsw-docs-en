- If your sequencing sample consists of multiple FASTQ files that correspond to different lanes on the
flow cell and are named the same except for the sequencing lane designation: `_L[lane number]` (e.g. "_L01"),
then the lane files will automatically be merged into one sample. In this case, pairing will be taken into
account for the lanes in the same way as described above, i.e. paired lane files will be merged into a paired
sample, and unpaired lane files will be merged into an unpaired sample.<br></br>
An example of merging four paired lanes into one sample:

<p align="center">
<img src={require('/img/eng/lanes_sample.png').default} width="300"/>
</p>

The first file in the merged sample card is the one with the lowest lane number among the others, and
the remaining lanes are added to it, symbolized by a plus in front of their names.
- If the files are merged incorrectly, you can split them by clicking on
the button <img src={require('/img/eng/split_lanes.png').default} width="250"/>, which is located under all
uploaded files in the "Uncategorized samples" section.
- If the necessary files are not merged into one sample, then you can merge them manually, either by
dragging the card of one lane file to another (to merge these two files), or by clicking on
the button <img src={require('/img/eng/merge_samples.png').default} width="250"/>, which is located under all
uploaded files (to merge all uploaded files). Note that the button will be available only if there are samples
of the same pairing in the "Uncategorized samples" section (i.e. either all samples are paired or all samples
are unpaired).

:::note
After running the analysis, a sample consisting of multiple lanes will initially appear as multiple samples.
At the bottom of each "sample" (which is actually a part of the future sample) it will be indicated that
"This lane part will be merged with others into single sample". The merging of lanes into one sample will
occur after the successful completion of the uploading and identification stages for all the lanes of the sample.
