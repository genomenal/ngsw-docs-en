<span> The sequencing type is usually detected automatically by Genomenal.
However, if you are sure which sequencing type was used to obtain your data, select the appropriate type
to speed up the analysis. This can be <b>whole genome sequencing</b> (WGS)
or <b>targeted selection</b> (sequencing with a targeted panel or whole-exome sequencing (WES)).<br></br>
After selecting "Targeted selection" as the sequencing type, you will see an additional field "Capture kit features".
The capture kit used during sequencing can be detected automatically by Genomenal. But if you are sure which
targeted panel was used when obtaining your data, you can select it from the list of built-in or
already <a href="/settings/capture-kits#upload-capture-kit">uploaded</a> panels in the system, as well as upload
the appropriate capture kit by opening the drop-down list in the "Capture kit features" field and selecting
the<br></br>option <img src={require('/img/eng/upload_ck.png').default} width="150"/>. Then you will see a field with
the choice of a reference genome for the capture kit. By default, the reference genome assembly corresponding to
the genomic intervals of the uploaded capture kit is detected automatically by Genomenal. You can determine
the assembly by clicking on the appropriate field and selecting the assembly in the drop-down list: hg19 or hg38.
Then click on the button <img src={require('/img/eng/upload_ck_on_upload_page.png').default} width="220"/> and
select the panel file in the opened File Browser.<br></br>Please note that by selecting the sequencing type
and capture kit, you define them for all samples of {props.set} at once.</span>
