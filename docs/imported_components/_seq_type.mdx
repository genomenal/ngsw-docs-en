The sequencing type is usually detected automatically by Genomenal.
However, if you are sure which sequencing type was used to obtain your data, select the appropriate type to speed up the analysis. This can be whole genome sequencing (WGS) or targeted sequencing (exome or panel).
Please note that by selecting the sequencing type, you define it for all samples from the set at once.
