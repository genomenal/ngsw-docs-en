:::danger Attention!
If you're uploading sample files from a computer, and not by a link, do not refresh or close the tab
where files are being uploaded until it's complete. Otherwise, the upload will be interrupted.
To resume an interrupted upload, you can use the form described
in [the corresponding section](/uploading-samples/restore_upload). After the upload is completed,
you can close the tab, browser and turn off the computer - further analysis does not depend on your device.
