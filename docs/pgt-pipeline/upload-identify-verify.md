# Upload, identify and verify file

Each file from the pair is uploaded and checked for integrity. If the file is corrupted or malformed, the pipeline will stop.
At the identification stage, the data format, sequencing type and data source are determined.
Classifying the reads type (DNA or RNA) is an experimental function and does not affect further pipeline.
