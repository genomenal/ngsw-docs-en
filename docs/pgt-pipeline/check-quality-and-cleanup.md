# Check file quality and cleanup

The reads in the file(s) are checked for compliance with quality criteria. Depending on the results of the check, reads that do not meet the criteria will be filtered out, and nucleotides at the ends of reads with quality below the threshold will be truncated. In addition, the adapter sequences will be trimmed. This can significantly improve the quality of alignment and variant discovery.

In the eponymous section of “Workflow details”, information about the thresholds and quality checks that the samples passed are displayed. Here you can also download a detailed report with visualizations about each of the files before and after cleaning.
